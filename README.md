# Agentic Browser — Adaptive, Model-Agnostic Web Automation

### The Open Agent Browser Extension Powered by Python & MCP

> **Mission:** Build an intelligent browser agent that doesn’t just *understand* the web — it *acts* on it. Fully **model-agnostic**, **privacy-respecting**, and **BYOKeys-ready**.

---

## Overview

**Agentic Browser** is a **next-generation browser extension** powered by a **Python MCP (Model Context Protocol) server** that bridges modern LLM reasoning with real browser interactivity.  

Unlike typical AI assistants, this agent:
- **Understands** complex web content,
- **Takes actions** (like filling forms, navigating, comparing data),
- And **adapts** to any preferred model backend — *OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, local LLaMA, Mistral, etc.*

It’s your agent, your browser, your keys.

### **Key Architectural Principles**
- **Model-Agnostic:** Works with any LLM backend that supports API-style calls (OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic, Ollama, LM Studio).  
- **BYOKeys:** No vendor lock-in. Users supply their own API keys via `.env` or runtime UI input.  
- **MCP-Compliant:** Uses the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) for secure and structured interaction.  
- **Declarative Action System:** The model *declares* browser actions (e.g. `click`, `fill_form`, `extract`), and the extension executes them safely.

## Core Objectives

### 1. Model-Agnostic Agent Backend  
Create a flexible, LLM-agnostic backend using **Python**, **LangChain**, and the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** framework.  
Allows seamless switching across models (OpenRouter, Ollama, Anthropic, OpenAI, or local inference models).

### 2. Secure Browser Extension  
Design a robust and secure browser extension using the **WebExtensions API**, ensuring compatibility across Chrome, Firefox, and other Chromium-based browsers.

### 3. Advanced Agent Workflows  
Support sophisticated agentic workflows through **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **persistent memory**, and **automated multi-step browsing tasks** like form filling, search synthesis, and citation retrieval.

### 4. Guardrails & Transparency  
Implement strong **security and transparency layers**:  
- User approval before every actionable operation  
- Comprehensive activity logs  
- Intelligent content filtering  
- Safe domain allowlisting and IPI protection

### 5. Open-Source Extensibility  
Adopt a modular, community-driven architecture encouraging open innovation and integration of new capabilities, workflows, and extensions over time.

## Core Features

### Model-Agnostic Intelligence  
Works with any LLM provider — OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Ollama, LM Studio, or custom deployments — using a unified adapter layer.  

### Bring Your Own Keys (BYOKeys)  
No vendor dependency. Users supply their own API keys securely via local `.env` or UI input; keys never leave local context.

### Web Interaction Engine  
Real-time DOM inspection and manipulation for safe, human-approved automation — including form filling, data extraction, and structured web actions.

### Retrieval & Grounded Reasoning  
Leverages RAG pipelines to incorporate external data and enhance factual grounding, improving contextual accuracy in responses.

### Secure Architecture  
Every action is validated, logged, and requires explicit permission, ensuring responsible automation and explainability.

### Extensible Agent Tools  
Developers can easily extend agent capabilities by adding Python tools, context managers, or new browser-side actions.
